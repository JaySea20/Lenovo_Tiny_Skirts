## Lenovo_Tiny_Skirts  
# Custom Set of side skirts for mounting a Lenovo Tiny under a Voron 2 Printer  
  
Like so many have experienced, I had to find an alternative for the elusive Rpi4B.  
Lenovo Tiny PCs are, as the title suggests, small... And CHEAP!!!  
You can easily find the m600 models for less than $60. And if your dilligent and a bit lucky,  
you can find them as cheap as $35.  
  
That nets you:  
 - Pentium J3710 x86 4-Core Processor  
 - Two DDR4 Slots   
 - Bootable NVME m.2 slot  
 - 1GbE Ethernet  
 - Optional Wifi A+E Card  
 - Internal 2.5" SATA HDD/SSD Slot  
 - At about 7 watts consumption  
  
Plenty enough for Klipper  
  
A little bit of re-organization under the printer and PRESTO!
